# Python Capstone Project

**Objective:**

Processed and analyzed multi-table datasets to perform data cleaning, transformation, and insightful reporting, simulating a real-world business scenario.

**Key Steps & Achievements:**

Data Creation & Storage: Designed three structured datasets — Project, Employee, and Designation Level — in Pandas and saved them as CSV files for subsequent analysis.

Data Cleaning: Identified and imputed missing project costs using a running average algorithm implemented with a Python for loop.

**Data Transformation:** 

Merged datasets using employee IDs to consolidate project, employee, and designation data.

Calculated new metrics such as Bonus, Total Project Cost, and Updated Designation Levels based on business rules (e.g., promotion/demotion based on performance).

Exploratory Data Analysis: Generated descriptive statistics and filtered insights, such as projects handled by senior staff, ongoing vs. completed project distributions, and cost-based filtering.

Business Rule Implementation: Applied conditional logic to update designation levels and compute bonuses according to performance and project success rate.

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, CSV I/O operations, conditional data processing.

**Impact/Outcome:**
Successfully created a reproducible data pipeline that handled missing values, applied complex business logic, and generated actionable insights from structured datasets, showcasing skills applicable to Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and BI Developer roles
